=RHMC=

Generate 2+1 flavor HISQ gauge configurations using a rational hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. 

==Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo==

* It uses three-scale integrator , which naturally profits from the Hasenbuch trick. By default, the integration uses a leapfrog, but an Omelyan(2nd order minimal norm) integrator for the largest scale is also available.
