	2. [[vimwiki_cheat_sheet]]

To open the index file stored in /home/vishal/vimwiki/ just use the keybinding <leader>ww, for us the leader is just a comma (declared in init.vim)

use the following editor commands to get help with vimwiki packages
    * :h vimwiki
    * :h vimwiki-todo
    * :h vimwiki-local-mappings
The last two editor commands are redundent, they can be found in :h vimwiki editor command. 


----
%%the above ---- will crate a line in html web page.and this line will not show up in html web page in browser. 

To create a link, type a word, go to that word in normal mode and hit enter. Use tab and shift+tab to navitgate through the links forward and backwards respectively. Once hiting enter into links, you can type what I wrote here, no need to save it using :w or <leader>w (which I mapped in my init.vim file), hit backspace to go back to links(backspace automatically quits and saves the wiki files). 
 
To enter into link: simply use tab/shift-tab, to navigate and hit enter key. Don't double click the links to open them.

before you use <leader>whh, use ":VimwikiAll2HTML" to convert all links to html and display the html using <leader>whh or :Vimwiki2HTML.

To have local file links use: 
[[file:/home/vishal/path/to/file.pdf]]

To rename the links, use <leader>wr 

To make a heading write any word, go to normal mode and press '=', again and again to get the required headings or subheadings, you may press '-' to get rid of more number of '=' signs. 

= html_wiki =
*To set the browser use :  xdg-settings set default-url-scheme-handler file google-chrome.desktop* command in terminal. 

* To generate correponding html page of present wiki page use '<leader>oh', and to go to that html page use '<leader>ht', to get back to same wiki page use '<leader>wk'
* To convert all wiki pages to html use '<leader>ah'
* To have math function working, make sure you place that mathjax code below <head> of html page. use snippet 'latex' and press enter to do that.

5.8. Mathematical formulae                              *vimwiki-syntax-math*

Mathematical formulae are highlighted, and can be rendered in HTML using the
powerful open source display engine MathJax (https://www.mathjax.org/).

There are three supported syntaxes, which are inline, block display and
block environment.

Inline math is for short formulae within text. It is enclosed by single
dollar signs, e.g.:
 $ \sum_i a_i^2 = 1 $

Block display creates a centered formula with some spacing before and after
it. It must start with a line including only {{$, then an arbitrary number
of mathematical text are allowed, and it must end with a line including only
}}$.
E.g.:
 {{$
 \sum_i a_i^2
 =
 1
 }}$
*you can use \[ ..]\ without spaces from left, it works, look at [[HISQ]]*
Note: no matter how many lines are used in the text file, the HTML will
compress it to one line only.

Block environment is similar to block display, but is able to use specific
LaTeX environments, such as 'align'. The syntax is the same as for block
display, except for the first line which is {{$%environment%.
E.g.:
 {{$%align%
 \sum_i a_i^2 &= 1 + 1 \\
 &= 2.
 }}$

Similar compression rules for the HTML page hold (as MathJax interprets the
LaTeX code).

Note: the highlighting in Vim is automatic. For the rendering in HTML, you
have two alternative options:

1. installing MathJax locally (Recommended: faster, no internet required).
Choose a folder on your hard drive and save MathJax in it. Then add to your
HTML template the following line:

<script type="text/javascript" src="<mathjax_folder>/es5/tex-chtml.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>

where <mathjax_folder> is the folder on your HD, as a relative path to the
template folder. For instance, a sensible folder structure could be:

- wiki
  - text
  - html
  - templates
  - mathjax

In this case, <mathjax_folder> would be "../mathjax" (without quotes).

2. Loading MathJax from a CDN-server (needs internet connection).
Add to your HTML template the following lines:

<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>


== Multiple_wiki ==
use <leader>ws to select from multiple wikis, or
	1. use <leader> ww : _for default wiki 1_
	2. use <leader> w1 : for _wiki 1_
	3. use <leader> w2 : for _wiki 2_
