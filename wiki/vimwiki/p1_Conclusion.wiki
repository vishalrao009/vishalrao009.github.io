=Conclusion=


They presented SIMULATeQCD a multi GPU, multi-node, lattice code that allows simulation of dynamical fermions using the HISQ action and works for both NVIDIA and AMD back ends. 

HISQ action was mainly used since it is widely used for state-of-the art, high statistics QCD studies.

SIMULATeQCD is highly modularized so that anyone with modest knowledge of c++ can write their codes. The use of modules/modularization is very important for constantly changing personal and hardware. Functor syntax was used to balance the both needs (codes shall be close to mindful and flexible to computing system, since it improves the performance).

SIMULATeQCD has many production ready [[applications]] which will be listed in [[Design_strategy]] section. 

We gave some details on the Implementation of [[Physics_modules]] for easy and transparent reference in the future. What exist in SIMULATeQCD presently is code that has been relevant to HOTQCD projects.

==Characteristics of SIMULATeQCD==

1. Implementation of other 4D actions, such as Wilson action for fermions. The code works for N_f =2+1 and [[degenerate]] N_f systems, some work is still needed to include a dynamical charm quark.
2. A new feature allows measurement of Taylor coefficient of the pressure. 
3. The code is integrated with ILDG(International lattice Data Grid)
