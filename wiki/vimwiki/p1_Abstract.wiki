Abstract=

In this paper we explain :
1. Design Strategy
2. Implementation_details
3. Physics_modules and available algorithms
4. Key performance indicators for SIMULATeQCD (Simple Multi-GPU Lattice code for large scale QCD calculations, which is mainly developed by HOTQCD collaborations.)

Due to rise in Exascale (10^18 FLOPS/sec) computing, the competition among several GPU vendors has been fueled; now we have to write codes which support multiple API; also new development in algorithms and physics research requires frequent updates to existing software. At the same item thee is wide range of applications for HISQ fermions in QCD studies. 

This situation encourages the development of software featuring a HISQ action that is flexible, high performing, open source, easy to use and easy to adapt.
