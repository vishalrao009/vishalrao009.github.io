= Try15 More observables and m_prec=m_s =

== Objective ==

In this tryout, we will try to calculate more observables like <$s_{G}$>, <$L_{Bar}$>(which is mean Polyakov loop), we will do the following to achieve that. 

== procedure ==
	1. We shall first find quark masses for beta=6.285, use m_s/m_l=20; and use these masses to generate rational approximation files using m_prec=0 for psf2 and m_prec=m_s for psf1.  
	2. Use the rationa approximation file into RHMC parameter file and start generating the gauge configuration with always_acc=1, rand_flag=0, load_conf=0, conf_nr=0. generate 200 gauge configurations and find equilibrium point. 
	3. Use the equilibrium gauge file and random file for each node, and take 1000 measurements. (use always_acc=0, load_conf=2, rand_flag=0, and provide different seeds for generating random numbers, and provide the path to the gauge file and random file, and provide conf_nr=equilibriumfilenumber(example: 100)) 
	4. Once taken the measurements, find the required observables.

	2. [[parameter_rhmc_try_15]]

== Results ==
made mistakes several times in whole process, so I am making a program to do all the stuff. Follow try 16
