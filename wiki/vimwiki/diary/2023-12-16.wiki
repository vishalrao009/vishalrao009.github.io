= Try14 Preconditioning mass variation effects =

In this try, I would like to see how time_to_take_each next measurements are affected with preconditioning mass parameter(this is used to generate rational approximation file)

Preconditioning mass is used to optimize the speed up of generating successive measurements.

== objective ==
Objective is to find how the consecutive time to write gauge configuration (using RHMC) changes with preconditioning mass.

* It seems like the Mean of observables except plaquette depends on preconditioning mass.

== Conclusion ==
	1. We need to set m_s (mass of strange quark) as preconditioning mass, as it turns out that the program ratApprox is not utilising the preconditioning mass concept. If we use preconditioning mass then we shall have to find product of  {psf1}{psf2}{psf3} and hence, we shall require 3x3=9 such functions(3 functions are required to calculated for rhmc, which are HB, acceptance rate and molecular dynamics, for each of these 3 functions we need to find rational approximation ; i.e. to represent each of these in form of p(x)/q(x), and thus we need 9 such rational approximation(if we use m_prec), with each rational approximation we require 2 set of coefficients (1 for denominator and 1 for numerator; which can be of degree 14 or 12)) .but with use of preconditioning mass we see that output.rat just finds 6x2=12 total_functions (for numerator and denominator of 6 functions), instead of 9 functions.
	2. follow try15 for further progress.

== Remarks ==

1. The values of chi_ud, chi_s shall further be devided from factor of 4 as defined in [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1710.pdf|definations]]
