=Physics_modules=

These are topmost level of organisation level.
The modules utilize general physcis and mathematical [[classes]], which themselves sits at intermediate level. 

The following are present physics modules:
		1. [[RHMC]]
		2. [[Observables]]
		3. [[Inverter]]
		4. [[HISQ]]
		5. [[dslash]]
		6. [[gauge_updates]]
		7. [[gaugeFixing]]
		8. [[gradientFLow]]
		9. [[measureHadrons]]
		10. [[hyp]]

Note that some physics modules are also in applications. Well the [[applications]] are made up of these Physics_modules. 

==Lattice calculation==
A typical lattice calculation is divided into two parts, first gauge configurations are generated and then observables are measured on these gauge configurations. Most Observables are extracted from correlation_functions. Sometimes observables are extremely noisy and hence it is necessary to employ noise reduction techniques. SIMULATeQCD has modules to accomplish all of these tasks which will be discussed in present section. 

1. [[Configuration_generation]]
2. [[Measurement_of_observables]]
3. [[Noise_reduction]]
4. [[General_calculation_of_all-to-all_correlators]]
