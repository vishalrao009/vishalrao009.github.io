= Generating configurations =

The first process of calculation is to generate the gauge configurations for required dynamical system. Here on the basis of dynamical system we chose 
	a) [[RHMC]]  (for dynamical fermions in background of dynamical system)
	b) [[generateQuenched]] (for quenched case i.e. infinite/large mass quarks in background)
	
	
== Example == 

Let's say we are aiming to calculate the string tension for static quark anti quarks in (2,1) flavour qcd (i.e. 2 light quarks {u,d} and one strange quark(heavy) in background)

The first step is to generate the gauge configurations and find the configuration after the point of thermal equilibrium. and then to just generate more gauge configurations after equilibrium and measure the quantity on all of these new gauge configurations and average them and do some error analysis with them and plot some observables.
For this case we will be using [[RHMC]] where we will change the parameter file of RHMC.cpp source code or ./rhmc executable (which we build). 
The changes in parameter file are crucial for the calcuations and how to change these parameters will be discussed [[RHMC_Paramfile]].
