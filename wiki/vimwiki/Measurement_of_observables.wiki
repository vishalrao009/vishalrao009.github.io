=Measurement_of_observables=

The list of physical observables consisting of gauge constructs :
	* Polyakov loop
	* Polyakov loop correlators in the singlet,(must me measured in Spacial gauges, to this end Coulomb and Landau gauge fixing are implemented via [[over_relaxation]] updating, with OR parameter $\omega=1.3$)
	* Average
	* And octet channels
	* Chiral condensate
	* Topological charge
	* Topolotical charge density and its correlator
	* Weinberg operator calculated form field stregth tensor and O(a^2^) and O(a^4^) improved field stregth tensor.
	* The plaquette
	* Clover
	* Color-electric and color-magnetic correlator.
	* Energy-momentum tensor correlator
	* Also supports measurement of Taylor coefficient for expansion of log(Z_{QCD}) in $\mu_{B}/T$.
