<p>
We have reached the Moon; we have sent orbiters around almost all planets of solar system; we have figured out the fundamental laws of nature which agrees with experiment up to one part in \(10^{13}\), we have theories which shall be called as facts (since they are widely accepted in scientific community) like evolution and big bang event. Even then the philosophy of cause and effect is yet to reach the minds of large number of people.<br />
</p>

<p>
Even in academic settings people wear crystal rings, threads, bangles in hopes of getting protection from all sorts of fictitious devil which does not even exist in our nature. People praying and are taking shower in holy river during solar eclipse in hopes of protecting their almighty god (Sun). People going to some "saints" in hopes of medical/financial/educational/career/relationship problems getting resolved quickly. The fear of unknown future creating anxiety in these people is often resolved via consulting astrologers, tarot card readers, and other similar people clamming to reveal the future and change it by wearing their costly crystals in rings and by some other means. These are just few of the many things which fall under the category of superstitions.<br />
</p>

<p>
The rise of digital world have also made it easier for the 'thugs' to offer such magical facilities online and charging heavy price in the age of unemployment. The "business" of fear is rising with increase of chaos(entropy(entropy of universe will increase with time - \(2^{nd}\) law of thermodynamics)). The ignorance of inner working of natural world have created a trillion dollar industry around the world. <br />

<p>
Could you think any of the root cause of superstitious beliefs ?<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Presence of too many unknowns about the natural world. 

<li>
Lack of attitude of scientific inquiry.

<li>
Lack of scientific explainers around them.

</ol>
<p>
Quality education is becoming costly year after year. <br />

<p>
My journey to this day has not been purely rational; and I admit that I have been in fear of unknowns like some populous until I met a teacher who taught the class "how to think ?". <br />
