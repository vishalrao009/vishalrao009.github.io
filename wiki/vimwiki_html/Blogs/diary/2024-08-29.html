<p>
We have reached the Moon; we have sent orbiters around almost all planets of solar system; we have figured out the fundamental laws of nature which agrees with experiment up to one part in \(10^{13}\), we have theories which shall be called as facts (since they are widely accepted in scientific community) like evolution and big bang event. Even then the philosophy of cause and effect is yet to reach the minds of large number of people.<br />
</p>

<p>
Even in academic settings people wear crystal rings, threads, bangles in hopes of getting protection from all sorts of fictitious devil which does not even exist in our nature. People praying and are taking shower in holy river during solar eclipse in hopes of protecting their almighty god (Sun). People going to some "saints" in hopes of medical/financial/educational/career/relationship problems getting resolved quickly. The fear of unknown future creating anxiety in these people is often resolved via consulting astrologers, tarot card readers, and other similar people claiming to reveal the future and change it by wearing their costly crystals and by some other means. These are just few of the many things which fall under the category of superstitions.<br />

The rise of digital world have made it easier for the 'thugs' to offer such magical facilities online and charging heavy price in the age of unemployment. The "business" of fear is rising with increase of chaos(entropy(entropy of universe will increase with time - \(2^{nd}\) law of thermodynamics)). The ignorance of inner working of natural world have created a trillion dollar fraud industries (ex. Homeopathy, astrology) around the world. <br />

<p>
There could be many reasons to have belief in thaumaturgy.<br />
</p>

<p>
One of the major reasons it is still there could be because most of family members and friends believe in these things too. The statement often tossed around "Many people can't be wrong" is an huge assumption based on the thinking that the older believers might have found some evidence of such supernatural stuff that is why they are believing in it from thousands of years. Since when the custom and traditions makes something true?<br />
</p>

<p>
Sharing common belief helps to bond better with their parents and friends. The reason could be biological or sociological in nature and that is why it is very hard to let go of such beliefs.<br />
</p>

<div id="1. Superstitions in the digital age-1.1 Causes of Supernatural beliefs-1.1.2 Placebo Effect"><h3 id="1.1.2 Placebo Effect" class="header"><a href="#1. Superstitions in the digital age-1.1 Causes of Supernatural beliefs-1.1.2 Placebo Effect">1.1.2 Placebo Effect</a></h3></div>

<p>
Why would someone discard their beliefs if it provides them the psychological benefits? Little did they know that it is just a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect">placebo</a> effect. It becomes hard to not believe in these hokas-pokas if they have little psychological benefits to us. But the danger of having such beliefs creates more anxiety, fear by assuming anything can happen in this nature regardless of its natural laws.<br />

<p>
What would you do if you are sick; you go to a doctor. Similarly, if you want to know about natural world: what it is made up of, how does it functions, what it does not have and all sorts of similar doubts shall be cleared from a physicist rather than from a "baba". <br />
</p>

<div id="1. Superstitions in the digital age-1.1 Causes of Supernatural beliefs-1.1.4 Mythology of religions/GOD"><h3 id="1.1.4 Mythology of religions/GOD" class="header"><a href="#1.

<p>
I believe that the biggest reasons of believe in thaumaturgy is due to religion. Their belief in supernatural starts right from there. We don't choose religion,race we just inherit it from our parents. I am sure that if all of us were given a choice of choosing one; we would have chosen to be a person with scientific temper.<br />
</p>


<div id="1. Superstitions in the digital age-1.2 What can we do"><h2 id="1.2 What can we do" class="header"><a href="#1. Superstitions in the digital age-1.2 What can we do">1.2 What can we do</a></h2></div>

<p>
It is very hard to change someone if their beliefs are deep rooted for various reasons mentioned above. It takes empathy and kindness as opposed to the arrogance of "I know better" in order to free them from such beliefs. It is very slow process which we all ourselves have to go through in accepting the nature the way it is.<br />
</p>

<p>
The very acts of superstitions shall be ignored by each one of us since the younger generation is watching us. Moreover, rejection of such beliefs requires courage, knowledge of inner workings of this nature, ready to face isolation from believers, and presence of skeptic mind to put everything under scrutiny.     <br />

I would like to attach a quote by the first scientist:<br />
“The seeker after truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them," the first scientist wrote, "but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration and not the sayings of human beings whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.”<br />
― Ibn al-Haytham<br />
</p>

<p>
Article 51 A(h) is one of the Fundamental Duties that states: It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform. We can at least be true to our constitution.<br />
