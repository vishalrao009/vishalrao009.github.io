We have reached the Moon; we have sent orbiters around almost all planets of solar system; we have figured out the fundamental laws of nature which agrees with experiment up to one part in \(10^{13}\), we have theories which shall be called as facts (since they are widely accepted in scientific community) like evolution and big bang event. Even then the philosophy of cause and effect is yet to reach the minds of large number of people.<br />
</p>

<p>
Even in academic settings people wear crystal rings, threads, bangles in hopes of getting protection from all sorts of fictitious devil which does not even exist in our nature. People praying and are taking shower in holy river during solar eclipse in hopes of protecting their almighty god (Sun). People going to some "saints" in hopes of medical/financial/educational/career/relationship problems getting resolved quickly. The fear of unknown future creating anxiety in these people is often resolved via consulting astrologers, tarot card readers, and other similar people clamming to reveal the future and change it by wearing their costly crystals in rings and by some other means. These are just few of the many things which fall under the category of superstitions.<br />
</p>

<p>
The rise of digital world have made it easier for the 'thugs' to offer such magical facilities online and charging heavy price in the age of unemployment. The "business" of fear is rising with increase of chaos(entropy(entropy of universe will increase with time - \(2^{nd}\) law of thermodynamics)). The ignorance of inner working of natural world have created a trillion dollar fraud industries around the world. <br />

<p>
One of the major reasons it is still there could be because most of family members and friends believe in these things too. The statement often tossed around "Many people can't be wrong" is an huge assumption based on the thinking that the older believers might have found some evidence of such supernatural stuff that is why they are believing in it. Sharing common belief helps to bond better with their parents and friends. The reason could be biological or sociological in nature and that is why it is very hard to let go of such beliefs.<br />

Why would someone discard their beliefs if it provides them the psychological benefits? Little did they know that it is just a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect">placebo</a> effect.  <br />

Rejection of such beliefs require courage and knowledge of inner workings of this nature; ready to face isolation from believers, an skeptic mind to put everything under scrutiny.    <br />

<p>
I would like to attach a quote by the first scientist:<br />
“The seeker after truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them," the first scientist wrote, "but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration and not the sayings of human beings whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of of its content, attack it from every side. he should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.”<br />
― Ibn al-Haytham<br />
</p>

<p>
Article 51 A(h) is one of the Fundamental Duties that states: It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.<br />
