= Date Modifiers =

We can modify some [[fundamental data types]] with the below modifiers.

There are four types of data modifiers in c++ :
	- Signed
	- Unsigned
	- Short
	- Long
	
And only the following data types can be modified with help of modifiers:
	* int
	* double
	* char



Have a look at the [[p5_data_tyes.cpp]]
