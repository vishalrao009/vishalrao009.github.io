[[Gauge_configurations]] are generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo using [[Metropolis-type-algorithms]]. To generate the random numbers they used a [[hybrid_Tausworthe]].

*Features of SIMULATeQCD*
	* currently SIMULATeQCD can generate pure SU(3) configurations and HISQ configurations with \(N_f=N_l+N_s\)  (for N_l light and N_s strange) dynamical quarks.
	* To enable simulation of 4 or more degenerate flavours, the determinant is split up into \(N_{pf}\)  [[pseudofermion_fields]] since the [[rational_approximation]] requires $N_{i}<4$.  Note that $N_{l}$ and $N_{s}$ are input parameters of rational approximation, while $N_{pf}$ is an input parameter of SIMULATeQCD. By default simulation runs with N_{pf}=1.
	* By default dynamical configurations are generated at $\mu_{B}=0$, but it is also possible to generate at pure imaginary $\mu_{B}$.
	* For pure gauge configurations generation (SU(3)) , standard Wilson gauge action is implemented with efficient sampling through [[heat_bath]](HB) and [[over_relaxation]] (OR) updates. 
	* For dynamical fermion configuration generation , [[HISQ]] action is used along with [[RHMC]] algorithm. 
	* To carry out matrix inversions, conjugate gradient algorithm is used, for which multiple right hand sides(MRHS), multiple shifts, and mixed precision implementation are available to improve Performance.
