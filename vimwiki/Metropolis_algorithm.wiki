= Metropolis Algorithm =

* It is also known as mother of all thermal Monte Carlo algorithms.

* Three Crucial concepts are required to understand Metropolis or all kinds of thermal monte carlo simulation.
		1) [[Importance Sampling]]
		2) [[Detailed Balance]]
		3) [[Acceptance Ratios]]
		

* Once we have understood above concepts, the theory of Metropolis algorithm is as follows.
* The Metropolis algorithm was introduced by Nicolas Metropolis and his co-workers in a 1953 paper on simulations of hard-sphere gases (Metropolis et al. 1953).
* We will use this algorithm to find equilibration time, measurement of expectation values, and the calculation of errors.
