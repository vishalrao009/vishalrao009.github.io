Here I will focus on the calculation of spatial string tension for $ (2+1) $ flavor dynamical quarks for \(N_{\tau}=8,10,12\). We have SIMULATeQCD for generating action for (2+1) flavor dynamical quarks using HISQ formulation.  

We shall use the SIMULATeQCD to generate the configurations and then we shall measure the spatial potential on the configurations.
