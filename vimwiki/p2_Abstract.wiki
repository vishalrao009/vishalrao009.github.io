1. They calculated the spatial string tension in (2+1) flavor QCD with physical strange quark mass and almost physical light quark masses using lattices with temporal extent \(N_{\tau}=4,6,8\).  
2. They then compared the results with predictions of dimensionally reduced QCD.
3. This suggested them that;  also in presence of light dynamical quarks dimensional reduction works well down to temperature 1.5T_{c}
