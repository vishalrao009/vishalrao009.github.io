=Calculation of string tension=

I have installed the [[https://github.com/LatticeQCD/SIMULATeQCD|SIMULATeQCD]] code in my userspace located in /root/project1/ of container named virat.
I have build the all executables by command 'make -j 19', it worked in almost 80 minutes. 

The [[objective]] and [[calculation]] of the project is explained in the link.
