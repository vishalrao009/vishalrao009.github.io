<ul>
<li>
By default c++ pass by value. i.e. values are copied to function parameters.

<li>
Pass by value just copies the data to parameter variable: look at code below
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void change_var(int a)
	{
	a++;
	}
	void main()
	{
	int x=20;
	std::cout&lt;&lt;change_var(x)&lt;&lt;x; //here value 20 is copied in parameter a and is incremented. the changes will be only made in parameter 'a' and not in variable 'x', it will generate output as : 21 20
	}
</pre>

</ul>
<div id="Pass by value, pass by reference, pass by pointers.-Pass by reference"><h2 id="Pass by reference" class="header"><a href="#Pass by value, pass by reference, pass by pointers.-Pass by reference">Pass by reference</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
pass by reference will change the data globally just like pass by pointer.

<li>
have a look at code to understand.
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void change_var(int &amp;a) //here a is an reference to variable 'x'
	{
	a++;
	}
	void main()
	{
	int x=20;
	std::cout&lt;&lt;change_var(x)&lt;&lt;x; //here value 20 is in x, and x is referenced by parameter/alias 'a'. the changes will be made in parameter 'a' and in variable 'x', it will generate output as : 21 21
	}
</pre>

</ul>
	

<div id="Pass by value, pass by reference, pass by pointers.-Pass by pointers"><h2 id="Pass by pointers" class="header"><a href="#Pass by value, pass by reference, pass by pointers.-Pass by pointers">Pass by pointers</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Pass by pointers will also change the data globally. It is suggested to use pass by reference over pointers.

<li>
have a look at the code:
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void change_var(int *a) //here a is an pointer to variable 'x' and a stores memory address of varialbe x. 
	{
		*a++; //we need to dereference the pointer to access its value. 'a' holds the address and *a has its value.
	}
	void main()
	{
	int x=20;
	std::cout&lt;&lt;change_var(&amp;x)&lt;&lt;x; //here value 20 is in x, and x is referenced by parameter/alias 'a'. the changes will be made in parameter 'a' and in variable 'x', it will generate output as : 21 21
	}
</pre>

</ul>
