<p>
Variables are created by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
int a=5; (we have some area in memory with value 5 and we refer it with name 'a')

<li>
We need to ask where is this variable located in memory, we have an operator(&amp;a) called 'address of' which stores the address of varialbe 'a'.

<li>
address are stored with 12 characters of hexadecimal numbers. ex. 0xAEC034523823 . storing this number requires 12.4=48 bits of memory. (becuase each hexadecimal number is from 0 to 15(F), and 4 bits are sufficient to store any hexadecimal number)

<li>
since 4 bytes (48 bits) are sufficient for storing address we can use integer data type to store address of variable.

<li>
pointers points/stores address of varialbe so they are declared and assigned by : int * p=&amp;a; (here p is pointer varialbe which will store address of varialbe 'a')

</ul>

<p>
Reference is an alias or another name for any given variable.
The way we create an alias is:
	int a=5;
	int &amp; b=a;  //here b is an alias of a, now we can access the variable a by two methods, a or b.
	\\(int &amp;b, int &amp; b , int&amp; b - all are same)	
		Behind the scenes references uses pointers, but we don't need to go to that level.

<ol>
<li>
References are majorly used when we are passing large amount of data in a function, when we pass data inside a function we generally copy that data to parameter variables. Have a look below the use of references:

</ol>
	
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void add(int &amp;a, int &amp;b)
	return a+b;
	
	void main()
	{
	int x=50;
	int y=40;
        std::cout&lt;&lt;add(x,y);     // in this way the data 50 and 40 is not copied in any variable, and it saves memory, it is useful when passing billions of data points in a function or passing a vector. It helps in saving memory.
        return 0;
	}
</pre>
	
<ol>
<li>
Like pointers any changes made to alias does not remains inside the function only, and changes will reflect outside the function as well.
	code:
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void increment(int &amp;a)
	{
	a++;
	}
	void main()
	{
	int x=5;
	std::cout&lt;&lt;increment(x)&lt;&lt;x; //it will print 6 6
	}

</pre>

<li>
Location we set to alias/reference is permanent, once we set an alias, we can not make it alias to something else. 
<pre c++>
	int a=3;
	int c=30;
	int &amp;b=a;
	b=c; // this statement will store value of c in b which points to address of a, so a=30=b=c
</pre>

<li>
Alias and original variable has same address and it can be checked by following code:
<pre c++>
	#include&lt;iostream&gt;
	void main()
	{
	int a=5;
	int &amp;b=a;
	std::cout&lt;&lt;&amp;a&lt;&lt;'\t'&lt;&lt;&amp;b;
	}
</pre>

</ol>
