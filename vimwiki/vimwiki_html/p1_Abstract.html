Abstract=
</p>

<p>
In this paper we explain :
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Design Strategy

<li>
Implementation_details

<li>
Physics_modules and available algorithms

<li>
Key performance indicators for SIMULATeQCD (Simple Multi-GPU Lattice code for large scale QCD calculations, which is mainly developed by HOTQCD collaborations.)

</ol>
<p>
Due to rise in Exascale (10^18 FLOPS/sec) computing, the competition among several GPU vendors has been fueled; now we have to write codes which support multiple API; also new development in algorithms and physics research requires frequent updates to existing software. At the same item thee is wide range of applications for HISQ fermions in QCD studies. 
</p>

<p>
This situation encourages the development of software featuring a HISQ action that is flexible, high performing, open source, easy to use and easy to adapt.
