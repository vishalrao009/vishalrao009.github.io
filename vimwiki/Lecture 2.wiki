*References*
    - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates
    - We will be studing about only [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function_template|function templates]] and abbreviated function template using keyword 'auto' which is also explained in above link(auto is just c++20 feature).
    
    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Main points*
	* Templates have been introduced in 1991.
	* we use templates like:
		{{{cpp
		template <typename/class T>  //we can use the keywords typename or class 
		T function_name(T parameter_names) // scope of T is within the function only. 
		{

		}


		}}}
	* we can use template using keyword `auto` which is just c++20 feature only.(compile with -std = c++20 ) 
		{{{cpp
		auto function_name(auto parameter_names)
		{
		// function body; note that 'auto' will deduce the type for us. 	
		}
		}}}

	* `Instantiation`
		It is process of making codes by compiler, In previous [[lecture 1]] we saw that the compiler was make codes for us, and that is known as Instantiation.
